# PokeDex

This project is a Pokedex application built with Angular. It features two views:

Pokemon List: This view displays a list of all Pokemon, with the ability to search for a specific Pokemon by name, or filter the list by type, height, and weight. The Pokemon are also displayed with pagination.

Sightings: This view allows users to register a Pokemon sighting and stores it in IndexDB. It also displays a list of all registered sightings.
